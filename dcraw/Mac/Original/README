Users:

This version of the dcraw executable is the version that was
originally shipped with LightZone 3.9.2 for Mac. 
You shouldn't need this file, but if you do, you probably *need* it.

To restore your Mac LightZone 3.9.2 dcraw file,
download this file to your LightZone.app/Contents/Resources/Java folder.


Developers:

You shouldn't need to do anything in this folder.
