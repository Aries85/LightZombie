# LightZone dcraw executable for Mac

Users:

This [will be] the `dcraw` executable file for use with
LightZone 3.9.2 on Mac.

Rename the original `dcraw` file in your
LightZone.app/Contents/Resources/Java folder
and replace it with the one in this folder.

There might be a newer, but not fully tested, version in the 'Unstable' branch.

In the event of trouble,
the original LightZone 3.9.2 executable can be found in the 'Original' folder.

Developers:

New builds initially go into the 'Unstable' branch.
If no problems turn up after a reasonable amount of time,
they'll be merged into the 'master' branch.
