# LightZone dcraw executable for Mac

Users:

This is the `dcraw` executable file for use with
LightZone 3.9.2 on Mac.

Rename the original `dcraw` file in your
LightZone.app/Contents/Resources/Java folder
and replace it with the one in this folder.

At the moment, the
[updated Mac dcraw](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/raw/Unstable/dcraw/Mac/dcraw)
is unproven.
It was compiled on Lion (OS X 10.7),
and it's unknown if it will run properly on earlier versions of OS X.
It should be considered somewhere between 'alpha' and 'beta' software.
If you don't need it for your current cameras,
you probably should stick with
[the original version](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/raw/master/dcraw/Mac/Original/dcraw)
shipped with LZ 3.9.2.
Please report any problems through the Issue Tracker.

In the event of trouble,
the original LightZone 3.9.2 `dcraw` executable
can be found in the 'Original' folder
or just use the link above.

Developers:

New builds initially go into the 'Unstable' branch.
If no problems turn up after a reasonable amount of time,
they'll be merged into the 'master' branch.
