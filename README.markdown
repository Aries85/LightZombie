# LightZone is dead. Or IS IT...?

The LightZombie Project is an unofficial, volunteer, open-source project
that aims to keep the LightZone photo editor usable for as long as practical.
LightZone's creator, Light Crafts Inc., ceased operations in September 2011.

New LightZone licenses are no longer being sold,
but existing licenses continue to work.
The activation process goes through Digital River's eSellerate,
not through Light Crafts, so activation isn't a problem.

This github project is the technical side of the Zombie Project.
Here you will find files to download,
a tech-oriented [wiki](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/wiki),
and an issue tracker.
Software developers are welcome to contribute;
at the moment we could use Mac and Linux developers to support those platforms.

If you've lost the install package for LightZone and need a replacement,
or if you're on a Mac and have found out that
the 3.9 version doesn't work with Java SE6 or Lion,
you'll find links to download the latest/final install packages
over on the [wiki](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/wiki).

**Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/wiki)
for more information.**

## Navigating github

There's a full-width button bar just below the project name.
The buttons of interest are:

* **Code** -- here you'll find files for downloading,
mixed in with some other stuff you probably don't care about.
In particular, the README files are used by github
to create descriptions like this one you're reading right now.
To download a file,
you'll probably need to click on the "Raw" option after you click the file.

* **Issues** -- here you can enter an issue report for any problems that
you find, and to see what issues have been reported and/or fixed.

* **Wiki** -- here is some tech information provided by the LightZombie
staff.

## The LightZombie necromancy staff:

* Tex Andrews - communications, coordination
* Doug Pardee - dcraw, camera raw profiles, Windows, github
* (open) - Mac
* (open) - Linux
