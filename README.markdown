**LightZone is dead. Or is it...?**

The LightZombie Project is a volunteer, open-source project that aims
to keep the LightZone photo editor usable for as long as practical.
LightZone's creator, Light Crafts Inc., ceased operations in September 2011.
New LightZone licenses are no longer being sold,
but existing licenses continue to work.
LightZone hadn't been updated to
[support new digital camera models](ProjectRawFileSupport)
since about the beginning of 2010, which means that
most modern camera models aren't supported.
One of the primary aims of the LightZombie Project is to add that support in.

This github project is the technical side of the Zombie Project.
Here you will find files to download,
a tech-oriented [wiki](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/wiki),
and an issue tracker.
Developers are welcome to contribute;
at the moment we have no Mac or Linux developers to support those platforms.

**The LightZombie necromancy staff:**

* Tex Andrews - communications, coordination
* Doug Pardee - dcraw, camera raw profiles, Windows, github
* (open) - Mac
* (open) - Linux
