The `q13rtc.rb` and `gmccrtc.rb` scripts create an initial Raw Tone Curve
from observed uncorrected values in a Raw file.
These can provide a significant "jump start" on creating a Raw Tone Curve.
Instructions are provided in the comments.
These are Ruby scripts, so you'll need a Ruby interpreter to use them.
