# Raw profiles for new camera models

Users:

One of the features of LightZone is that it automatically applies
a ZoneMapper-type tool called a Raw Tone Curve
to Raw files from recognized cameras.
LightZone *can* process Raw files without a Raw Tone Curve for that camera,
but the result will tend to be somewhat on the dark side.

Here are some Raw Tone Curve files for cameras that weren't included
in LightZone 3.9.
Install the file(s) into your normal LightZone template folder.
On Windows, there's a `LightZone\Templates` folder in your main documents folder.

About specific profiles:

* Pentax K-r : a copy of the Pentax K-X profile. Both camera models use the same sensor and processing hardware.

Developers:

The pre-existing profiles can be found in the `lightzone.jar` file
that is part of the LightZone installation.
This file is simply a ZIP file.

The profiles are in the `com/lightcrafts/ui/editor/assoc/resources` folder
inside the `lightzone.jar` ZIP file.
