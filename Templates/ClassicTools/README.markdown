# Classic LZ tools and classic versions of LZ tools

LightZone has had some tools that it no longer includes in the tool bar.
These tools still exist in the code, though,
and can be used via these styles.
Not all of these are particularly useful, but here they are.

* Channel Mixer -- this is a conversion to black-and-white
that uses the well-known channel-mixing approach.

* Classic Relight -- this older version of the Relight tool uses a different
approach, especially in response to the Shadows and Highlights sliders.
It seems to be particularly valuable for handling images
with an extremely wide tonal range,
and LZ still uses it for that purpose in the
Polarizer and the High Dynamic Range styles.
LZ also uses this version in the Soft Wow style.

* Tone Mapper -- this ancestor of Relight uses a very different approach to
redistributing the tonal range in an image.
It seems to concentrate on controlling highlights.
There's not a lot of information available on it.

* Contrast Mask -- superfically this tool appears to be the same as Tone Mapper,
but under the hood it's a somewhat different implementation.
This is *not* the classic darkroom "contrast mask" operation.

* Classic NR -- this older version of the Noise Reduction tool
provides more controls.
Whether it's any more effective than the current version is a different matter.

* Classic HSL -- this older version of the Hue/Saturation tool
doesn't have the Vibrance slider.
It's not clear that there's any special merit to using this tool.
